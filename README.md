# Trip-Click-Project

## What did we set ourselves and what have we accomplished?
In this project we tasked ourselves to create a travel planner where the user can search the city they are looking to travel to in the weather dashboard so that they can see what the weather will look like over the next five days. Furthermore we also set out to create a currency convertor so the user can also see what the exchange rates would be for the location they are looking to travel to, for example if they need to change their currency from GBP to EUR.

In addition to the following we have also decided to add in hyperlinks to numerous travel websites so the user can then instantaneously swap over to the travel booking website of their choosing.

## Technologies Used:
The technologies we used are Vs code, HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with integration of APIâ€™s.
